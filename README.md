# Linux File Permissions Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to manage file and directory permissions in Linux using commands like `ls -la` and `chmod`. The goal was to update permissions in the **projects directory** to align with organizational security requirements and improve system security.

## Tasks Completed
1. **Checked File and Directory Details**  
   - Used `ls -la` to list all files and their permissions, including hidden files.
   - Identified files and directories that required updates.

2. **Changed File Permissions**  
   - Removed write access for "other" on `project_k.txt`.
   - Updated `.project_x.txt` to ensure it was read-only for the group.

3. **Changed Directory Permissions**  
   - Restricted access to the `drafts` directory so only the `researcher2` user could execute it.
